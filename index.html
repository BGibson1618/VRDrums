							<h1>Introduction</h1>
							<p>The benefits of music education, especially for children, are numerous. Time and again,
								research shows that learning to play an instrument and read music is correlated with
								improved hand-eye-coordination, pattern recognition, and problem-solving skills.
								Unfortunately, music and arts are often the first things to get cut from the
								curriculum when a school district finds itself short on funding. The VR Drums project
								endeavors to solve this problem by offering a tool for music
								education that	is cheap, silent, and, most importantly, effective.</p>
							<p>We intend to achieve this by embedding a virtualized instrument
								in an environment that contains all the tools
								necessary to practice one's technique, timing, and music literacy. We believe that by
								achieving a sufficient level of realism any skills learned in the virtual environment
								will translate to a physical drum set and vice-versa.
								Recent
								advancements in the field have yielded powerful virtual reality hardware at
								affordable prices. By keeping our application lightweight enough to run on a standalone
								VR rig, we believe we can make music education accessible at almost any budget.</p>
							<p>While this began as a senior project from my time at Cal State, Northridge, it has
								evolved into a personal venture that I continue to improve.</p>

							<h1>About</h1>
							<p>
								The application provides the user with an eight-piece drum kit rendered in a VR
								space. A pair of virtual drum sticks tracks the user's hand movements, and colliders
								on each of the drum objects will produce a sound any time the head of a drum stick
								crosses the surface of a drum head. The pitch of the sound varies slightly
								depending on where the collision occurs. The virtual pedals of the hi-hat and bass
								drums are engaged when the user pulls the trigger on their left and right controller,
								respectively. The other objects in the scene are determined by which of the three
								play modes is currently active, as described below.

								The heart of the VR Drums can be found in Tutorial Mode. In this mode, the drum
								heads are given colors and the user has
								a large, lined board centered in his field of view matching the format used in drum
								music notation. When the user presses the play button, game objects representing
								musical notes begin instantiating on the right side of the board and move left
								as if the user were reading a page of sheet music. Additionally, the notes are color
								coded to the drum they represent. For example, the top line of the clef represents the
								hi-hat, and so the notes that spawn on that line are the same color as the hi-hat
								itself. At the left of the board is a vertical bar which cues the user as to when a
								note is meant to be played. When the user strikes a drum object, the distance between
								the
								note and target bar is measured to determine how accurate the user's timing is. A
								score is generated based on their precision. Is the music going too fast? Just to the
								right of the drum set is a selector box where the user can adjust the tempo. </p>

							<h1>Skills</h1>
							<p>
								When this project began, only a few members of the group had experience with Unity,
								and none of us had any experience with programming for virtual reality. As project
								lead, I identified six areas in which my team would need to become proficient:
								<ul>
									<li>Designing custom game objects</li>
									<li>Building a user interface in a VR space</li>
									<li>Incorporating audio files in a way that gives the drum set a realistic
										sound</li>
									<li>Learning to use the Open XR standard and integrating VR hardware input
										devices</li>
									<li>Translating sheet music notation into a text file that could serve as an
										input for Tutorial Mode</li>
									<li>Integrating all of the above to create a fun and engaging application</li>
								</ul>
								My fantastic group mates took on the challenges of learning to use Blender to create
								realistic looking drums, sourcing sound clips, understanding how user interfaces are
								different in VR, and devising a system for converting sheet music into usable text
								files. That left me the tasks of learning Open XR and creating a cohesive program out
								of the assets my team created.
							</p>
							<p>
								While Unity is known for having a thriving community of developers and excellent online
								documentation, learning to use Khronos's Open XR standard proved to be quite the
								challenge. The standard was so new at the time that I often found myself reading
								documentation or following tutorials that were out of date despite only being a few
								months old. There were times when I considered developing this project strictly for
								the Quest 2 and following Oculus's documentation, but ultimately I decided that
								cross-platform compatibility was an essential aspect of the project and stuck with
								Open XR. I am happy to have some experience with the standard as it seems to be the
								future of VR and AR development
							</p>
							<p>
								Integrating assets between multiple programmers during a time of remote learning was
								unexpectedly complex as well. Of the six members in the group, only two
								of us had access to VR rigs and PC's capable of running them. This meant that the
								majority of the group was trying to develop assets for a virtual reality application
								without being able to test them in VR. In an effort to find ways for my team to be
								productive despite the obstacles caused by the pandemic, I learned	how	to create
								custom templates in	Unity and how to use the XR Device Simulator. I made a template
								with the Universal Render Pipeline enabled and which contained XR Origin and XR Device
								Simulator prefabs. I then helped my team install the template on their individual
								computers. My teammates without VR rigs could use the XR Device Simulator to move
								around the VR environment and interact with VR assets, and my teammates with VR rigs
								could simply disable the simulator and use their hardware as normal. While this is
								more of a leadership success story than one of programming proficiency, I did become
								more familiar with Unity and Open XR in the process.
