							<h1>Introduction</h1>
							<p>The benefits of music education, especially for children, are numerous. Time and again,
								research shows that learning to play an instrument and read music is correlated with
								improved hand-eye-coordination, pattern recognition, and problem-solving skills.
								Unfortunately, music and arts are often the first things to get cut from the
								curriculum when a school district finds itself short on funding. The VR Drums project
								endeavors to solve this problem by offering a tool for music
								education that	is cheap, silent, and, most importantly, effective.</p>
							<p>We intend to achieve this by creating a virtualized instrument with enough realism
								that the user can learn skills that will translate to the real world and then
								surrounding that instrument with a virtual environment that contains all the tools
								necessary to practice one's technique, timing, and music literacy. Recent
								advancements in the field have yielded powerful virtual reality technology at
								affordable prices. By keeping our software lightweight enough to run on a standalone
								VR rig, we believe we can make music education accessible at almost any budget.</p>
							<p>While this began as a senior project from my time at Cal State, Northridge, it has
								evolved into a personal venture that I continue to improve.</p>

							<h1>About</h1>
							<p>
								The application provides the user with an eight-piece drum kit rendered in a VR
								space. A pair of virtual drum sticks tracks the user's hand movements, and colliders
								on each of the drum objects will produce a sound any time the head of a drum stick
								crosses the surface of a drum head. The pitch of the sound will vary slightly
								depending on where the collision occurs. The virtual pedals of the hi-hat and bass
								drums are engaged when the user pulls the trigger on their left and right controller,
								respectively. The other objects in the scene are determined by which of the three
								play modes is currently active as described below.

							<p>
								The heart of the VR Drums can be found in Tutorial Mode. In this mode, the drum
								heads are given colors and the user has
								a large, lined board centered in his field of view matching the format used in drum
								music notation. When the user presses the play button, game objects representing
								musical notes begin instantiating on the right side of the board and move left
								as if the user were reading a page of sheet music. Additionally, the notes are color
								coded to the drum they represent. For example, the top line of the clef represents the
								hi-hat, and so the notes that spawn on that line are the same color as the hi-hat
								itself. At the left of the board is a vertical bar which cues the user as to when a
								note is meant to be played. When the user strikes a drum object, the distance the
								note and target bar is measured to determine how accurate the user's timing is, and a
								score is generated based on their precision. Is the music going too fast? Just to the
								right of the drum set is a selector box where the user can adjust the tempo. </p>

							<h1>Skills</h1>
							<p>In order to make VR Drums a reality, our team has had to become proficient in Blender
							to make our custom game objects, Unity to create the basics of the application and the user
							interface, and OpenXR so that our software could run on the most popular VR platforms
							currently available. Additionally, in order to create an environment that could be truly
							effective in terms of music education, our skill sets had to expand into the realms of
								musical
							time signatures, converting between the relative time of musical tempo and the absolute
							time of beats per minute, and translating sheet music into a text format that could be
							processed by Unity.</p>
